Example 1: Sine Wave
====================

y = A * sin(kx - phi),

A = Amplitude,
k = Phase Difference between adjacent particles,
x = Position of the particle,
phi = Phase


Example 2: Brownian Motion
==========================

* Rendering a sin wave.
* Brownian Motion
* Patterns: *image to draw with a software tool which responds to the speed of the mouse.*
* Simulating the solar system.
* Making a simple pendulum.
* Colliding Spheres.
* Simulating free fall in different materials.
* **Snake**
